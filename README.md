## Assignment 4 - Colour Grid From Scratch

https://coursework.vschool.io/color-grid-from-scratch/

### Instructions

Without using the bootstrap grid system, create a website that looks like this:
<img src="https://coursework.vschool.io/content/images/2015/07/boot.png" alt="color grid example">

You don't have to worry about making it responsive at this point.

Here are the colors:

* #F5C6D6
* #EE2E84
* #85CFD8
* #8DC63F
* #E76E34

Hints:

It's easiest to get the even white "spacing" by actually using a thick, white border around the shapes.
In order to use percentage widths and not have them wrap, you'll need to add the following line to the top of your CSS:

CSS 
  {box-sizing: border-box; 
  font-size: 0px;}
